There's a gang who live for violence
On the streets of East L.A.
Survival is to fight or kill
If anything gets in their way
There's a girls from a land of plenty
Who always wanted more
Now she's found her true vocation
Working for the lord
There's a mother in a vacuum
In fact she's now divorced
She's the spirit of the sixties
Still waiting for tha call

And the leaders of the new frontiers
Turn their thoughts toward the sky
No acid rain more greener fields
And micro genetic births
And the leaders of the new frontiers
Sail their shpis toward the stars
In search of new horizons
The answer to it all

There's a child who cries of hunger
In a town that's got no name
He doesn't know he's born yet
But he's learnt to live with pain
In a city just for dreamers
Where the sign says "Sex for sale"
You can live out all your fantasies
Behind the windows without shame
And still we think of east and west
And still we're black and white
And while the poor still hate the rich
I guess we're always gonna fight

And the leaders of the new frontiers
Turn their thoughts toward the sky
No acid rain more greener fields
And micro genetic births
And the leaders of the new frontiers
Sail their shpis toward the stars
In search of new horizons
The answer to it all

There's a dickhead blowing money
Cause he's never had to work
While the homeless live in boxes
Eating garbage out the dirt
There's a world that stand united
Where once the madman reigned
It's a lesson to us all
The threat of war is too insane
And half the planet's starving
And that's a fact of life
Have we got used to all those pictures
That we can't tell wrong from right?

And the leaders of the new frontiers
Turn their thoughts toward the sky
No acid rain more greener fields
And micro genetic births
And the leaders of the new frontiers
Sail their shpis toward the stars
In search of new horizons
The answer to it all
