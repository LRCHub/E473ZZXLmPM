Rain in my temple
Tales in my wine
Collarless gowns
You've got to make new frontiers

Red painted terminal
Tables in white
Comfort abounds
You've got to break through frontiers

Rain in my temple
Tales in my wine
Time let you die
You've got to make new frontiers

Red painted terminal
Tables in white
New daily sight
You've got to break your frontiers
