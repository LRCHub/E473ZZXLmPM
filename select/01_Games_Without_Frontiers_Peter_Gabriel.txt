Hans plays with Lotte, Lotte plays with Jane
Jane plays with Willy, Willy is happy again
Suki plays with Leo, Sacha plays with Britt
Adolf builds a bonfire, Enrico plays with it

Whistling tunes
We hide in the dunes by the seaside

Whistling tunes
We're kissing baboons in the jungle
It's a knockout

If looks could kill, they probably will
In games without frontiers
War without tears
If looks could kill, they probably will
In games without frontiers
War without tears
Games without frontiers
War without tears

Andre has a red flag, Chiang Ching's is blue
They all have hills to fly them on except for Lin Tai Yu
Dressing up in costumes, playing silly games
Hiding out in treetops, shouting out rude names

Whistling tunes
We hide in the dunes by the seaside

Whistling tunes
We piss on the goons in the jungle
It's a knockout

If looks could kill, they probably will
In games without frontiers
War without tears
If looks could kill, they probably will
In games without frontiers
War without tears
Games without frontiers
War without tears
