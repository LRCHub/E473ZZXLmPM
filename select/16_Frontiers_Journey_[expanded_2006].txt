Oh yeah
Progress flys, into our lives
Got to find time, find time
To talk digit talk
You're doin' fine
Machines never mind
They never mind

Out on the border
Of a changing skyline
We put hope in front of fear
And all the Heroes
Have gone east of Eden
We all need new frontiers

Ooh It's a 3D rise
All tech-na-ca-jive
Take a video dive
War is for fools
Crisis is cool
Barbarians play

Out on the border
Of a changing skyline
We put hope in front of fear
And all the Heroes
Have gone east of Eden
We all need new frontiers

New, new, frontiers
Barbarians play away, away, away... play

Out on the border
Of a changing skyline
We put hope in front of fear
And all the Heroes
Have gone east of Eden
We all need new frontiers

Out on the border
Of a changing skyline
We put hope in front of fear
And all the Heroes
Have gone east of Eden
We all need new frontiers
